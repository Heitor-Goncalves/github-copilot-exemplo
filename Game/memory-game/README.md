# Memory Game

## Overview
This is a simple memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a 9x9 grid of cards that players can flip to find matching pairs. The objective is to match all pairs in the least number of moves.

## Files
- **src/index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the memory game.
- **src/style.css**: Contains the styles for the memory game, including layout and card styles.
- **src/main.js**: Implements the game logic, including card flipping and match checking.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any two cards to flip them over.
3. If the cards match, they will remain face up. If they do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
4. Continue flipping cards until all pairs are matched.
5. Keep track of your moves to improve your score in future games.

## Setup
To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No additional setup is required.
